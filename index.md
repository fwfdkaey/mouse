Computer Mouse
A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI (graphical user interface) and can move and select text, icons, files, and folders on your computer.

For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface (e.g., mouse pad or desk) in front of your computer. The picture is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel.

Who invented the mouse?
The mouse was initially known as the X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System and was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1963 while working at Xerox PARC. But, due to Alto's lack of success, the first widely used application of the mouse was with the Apple Lisa computer. Today, this pointing device is on virtually every computer.

When and who invented the first computer mouse?
What are the uses of a mouse?
Below is a list of computer mouse functions to give you an idea of all the things a mouse is capable of doing.

Move the mouse cursor - The primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the screen.
Open or execute a program - Once you've moved the pointer to an icon, folder, or another object clicking or double-clicking that object opens the document or executes the program.
Select - A mouse also allows you to select text or a file or highlight and select multiple files at once.

Drag-and-drop - Once something is selected, it can also be moved using the drag-and-drop method.
Hover - Moving the mouse cursor over objects with hover information helps discover each object's function. For example, hover the mouse over the "hover" link to see an example.
Scroll - When working with a long document or viewing a long web page, you may need to scroll up or down. To scroll, use the mouse wheel, or click-and-drag the scroll bar.
Perform other functions - Many desktop mice also have buttons that can be programmed to perform any function. For example, many mice have two side buttons on the thumb portion of the mouse. The button closest to the palm can be programmed to go back to the previously viewed web page in a browser.

How has the mouse increased computer usability?
By using a computer mouse, you don't have to memorize commands, such as those utilized in a text-based command line environment like MS-DOS. For example, in MS-DOS, you would need to know the cd command and dir command and type the commands on the keyboard to open a directory (folder) and view its files. Whereas a Windows user only has to double-click to open a folder and see its contents.
